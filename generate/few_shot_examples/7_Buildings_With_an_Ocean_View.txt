Problem Statement:There are n buildings in a line. You are given an integer array heights of size n that represents the heights of the buildings in the line. The ocean is to the right of the buildings. A building has an ocean view if the building can see the ocean without obstructions. Formally, a building has an ocean view if all the buildings to its right have a smaller height. Return a list of indices (0-indexed) of buildings that have an ocean view, sorted in increasing order.

Reference Implementation (Python3):
    class Solution:
        def findBuildings(self, heights: List[int]) -> List[int]:
            n = len(heights)
            answer = []

            for current in range(n):
                # If the current building is taller, 
                # it will block the shorter building's ocean view to its left.
                # So we pop all the shorter buildings that have been added before.
                while answer and heights[answer[-1]] <= heights[current]:
                    answer.pop()
                answer.append(current)
                
            return answer

Instance: heights = [5, 3, 2, 4, 1, 1]

Output (Merlin):
array arr1 = {
    value: [5, 3, 2, 4, 1, 1]
    color: ["green", "blue", "blue", "blue", "blue", "blue"]
    arrow: ["cur", null, null, null, null, null]
}
array arr2 = {
    value: [0]
    color: ["orange"]
}
