Problem Statement:
There is an undirected graph with n nodes, where each node is numbered between 1 and n. You are given a 2D array graph, where graph[u] is an array of nodes that node u is adjacent to. More formally, for each v in graph[u], there is an undirected edge between node u and node v. The graph has the following properties:

There are no self-edges (graph[u] does not contain u).
There are no parallel edges (graph[u] does not contain duplicate values).
If v is in graph[u], then u is in graph[v] (the graph is undirected).
The graph may not be connected, meaning there may be two nodes u and v such that there is no path between them.
A graph is bipartite if the nodes can be partitioned into two independent sets A and B such that every edge in the graph connects a node in set A and a node in set B.

Return true if and only if it is bipartite.

Reference Implementation (Python3):
class Solution(object):
    def isBipartite(self, graph):
        color = {}
        for node in xrange(len(graph)):
            if node not in color:
                stack = [node]
                color[node] = 0
                while stack:
                    node = stack.pop()
                    for nei in graph[node]:
                        if nei not in color:
                            stack.append(nei)
                            color[nei] = color[node] ^ 1
                        elif color[nei] == color[node]:
                            return False
        return True

Instance: graph = [[2,4], [1, 3], [4, 2], [1, 3]]

Output (Merlin):
graph g = {
  nodes: [A, B, C, D]
  edges: [A-B, B-C, C-D, D-A]
  value: [1, 2 ,3, 4]
}

stack s = {
    value: []
}
