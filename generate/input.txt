Problem statement: Given a binary tree root and an integer target, delete all the leaf nodes with value target.

Note that once you delete a leaf node with value target, if its parent node becomes a leaf node and has the value target, it should also be deleted (you need to continue doing that until you cannot).
Reference implementation: class Solution:
    def removeLeafNodes(
        self, root: Optional[TreeNode], target: int
    ) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        # Base case
        if root is None:
            return None

        # 1. Visit the left children
        root.left = self.removeLeafNodes(root.left, target)

        # 2. Visit the right children
        root.right = self.removeLeafNodes(root.right, target)

        # 3. Check if the current node is a leaf node and its value equals target
        if root.left is None and root.right is None and root.val == target:
            # Delete the node by returning None to the parent, effectively disconnecting it
            return None

        # Keep it untouched otherwise
        return root
Instance: root = [1,2,3,2,null,2,4], target = 2
